        NOTE: As in the above type, they both currently used (used strong as title, which is not safe to be targeted for rendering of toc). If they would like to have TOC, they will need to update the heading to be `h2, h3` as heading element for us to target in the CMS field in future.

                                <strong>PLEASANTON, CA — Jan. 14, 2020 –</strong> Accelerating study start-up is a top priority among leading life sciences companies. With this shift underway, an increasing number of organizations are selecting <a href="/products/vault-study-startup/">Vault Study Startup</a> from <a href="/">Veeva Systems</a> (NYSE:VEEV) to improve clinical trial efficiency and speed time to site activation. Seven of the top 20 largest global pharmaceutical companies are
                                adopting Vault Study Startup to bring together start-up activities and processes in a single, easy-to-use modern cloud application.
                            </p>

                            <p>“Study start-up is the clinical area with the most potential to improve overall trial efficiency because of a heavy reliance on manual processes and legacy standalone systems,” said Ashley Davidson, director of Veeva Vault Study Startup. “Customers are using Veeva Vault Study Startup to modernize their start-up operations and get trials up and running much faster.”</p>

                            <p>Veeva Vault Study Startup is an advanced application that eliminates manual processes to speed cycle times and trial execution. Sponsors can find the right site faster by automating and streamlining site identification, feasibility, and selection. Companies can also prioritize and assign tasks such as site contracting and budgeting throughout their study portfolio – an area that accounts for most of the cycle time during study start-up.<sup>1</sup></p>

                            <p>Vault Study Startup is part of Veeva’s <a href="/products/clinical-operations/">unified suite of clinical operations applications</a>, enabling sponsors and CROs to seamlessly share information and documents across CTMS, eTMF, and study start-up for better collaboration and increased efficiency throughout the study lifecycle.</p>
